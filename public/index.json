[{"authors":[null],"categories":["Segregation","Spatial"],"content":" In the last post we talked a bit about segregation and I showed how to calculate segregation across Oregon using census tracts to estimate segregation levels in counties. In this post, we’ll do a similar sort of thing, but we’ll look at the segregation of school districts in Oregon by exploring the distribution of demographics across schools within the district. Like last time, we’ll stick with only using the dissimilarity index because (a) it’s generally a useful and interpretable metric, (b) it’s probably the most widely used segregation indicator, even if it does have limitations, and most importantly (c) it’s easy to calculate and I’d like the focus of this post to be more on the data, rather than different methods for calculating segregation. In a later post, I’ll do the same sort of thing I’m doing here, but will use a few different methods so we get a more complete picture of the segregation in the given area.\nGetting school district boundaries We don’t actually have to have school district boundaries to calculate segregation, but they are helpful if, in particular, we want to visualize the segregation. There’s a couple of way to get school district boundaries, but the best from my perspective is the new {leaidir} package from Isabella Velásquez. You can install this package in R with\nremotes::install_github(\u0026quot;ivelasq/leaidr\u0026quot;) Then we can download shape files for all school districts across the entire United States with\nlibrary(leaidr) lea_get(here::here(\u0026quot;shape-files\u0026quot;)) Note that this will take a minute or two because you’re downloading a relatively large file.\nNow we load just the shape file we want, which in this case would, of course, be for Oregon. We have to refer to Oregon through it’s fips code, which for Oregon is 41 (see a complete list here).\nor \u0026lt;- lea_prep(here::here(\u0026quot;shape-files\u0026quot;), fips = 41) ## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile ## Source: \u0026quot;/Users/daniel/BRT/dsi-seedgrant/website_k-entry/shape-files/schooldistrict_sy1819_tl19.shp\u0026quot;, layer: \u0026quot;schooldistrict_sy1819_tl19\u0026quot; ## with 13315 features ## It has 18 fields This is a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object, but I prefer using simple features via the {sf} package, so I’ll convert it.\nlibrary(sf) or \u0026lt;- or %\u0026gt;% st_as_sf()  And now let’s take a quick look at the boundaries.\nlibrary(tidyverse) theme_set(theme_minimal(15) + theme(legend.position = \u0026quot;bottom\u0026quot;, legend.key.width = unit(1, \u0026quot;cm\u0026quot;))) ggplot(or) + geom_sf(fill = \u0026quot;#a9c7ef\u0026quot;) Wonderful! Note that this is considerably better than what you might get with, say tigris::school_districts which, for Oregon anyway, ends up with some missing data and empty polygons.\n Getting enrollment data Let’s calculate how economically segregated districts in Oregon are. We’ll do this by comparing, essentially, the proportion of economically disadvantaged students in a given school to the overall proportion in the district. In other words, if 40% of all students in a given school district are classified as economically disadvantaged, then we would expect roughly 40% of the students in each school to be classified as such. If, however, some schools have 90% classified as economically disadvantaged, while others have 10%, then we would conclude this district has at least some degree of economic segregation.\nFirst, let’s get the data we need. We’ll use data from the larger kindergarten-entry project. Each of these files were obtained originally from the NCES Common Core of Data.\nschool_lunch_elig \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;https://github.com/OR-K-Entry/k-entry/raw/master/data/nces/intermediary/schools_lunch.csv\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% filter(school_year == \u0026quot;2017-2018\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% select(ncessch, leaid, frl) school_mem \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;https://github.com/OR-K-Entry/k-entry/raw/master/data/nces/intermediary/schools_mem.csv\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% filter(school_year == \u0026quot;2017-2018\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% select(ncessch, total) %\u0026gt;% distinct() # Join and remove overall statewide data d \u0026lt;- left_join(school_mem, school_lunch_elig) %\u0026gt;% filter(leaid != 4100009) %\u0026gt;% select(leaid, ncessch, frl, total) d ## # A tibble: 1,244 x 4 ## leaid ncessch frl total ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 4100003 410000301061 91 130 ## 2 4100003 410000301062 41 77 ## 3 4100014 410001400748 265 416 ## 4 4100014 410001400754 58 97 ## 5 4100014 410001400761 153 281 ## 6 4100014 410001401026 60 100 ## 7 4100015 410001500821 358 425 ## 8 4100015 410001500831 191 237 ## 9 4100015 410001500853 222 308 ## 10 4100015 410001501588 26 36 ## # … with 1,234 more rows And we’re good to go!\n Calculating dissimilarity The dissimilarity index is non-spatial, so we can actually go ahead and calculate measures of segregation for each district using just the enrollment data above. First, let’s write a function to do this. We could, of course, use a different package, but this is such a simple measure I prefer to just use my own function.\ndissim \u0026lt;- function(ind, total) { if((sum(is.na(ind)) / length(ind)) \u0026gt;= 0.5) { return(NA_real_) } a \u0026lt;- ind / sum(ind, na.rm = TRUE) b \u0026lt;- (total - ind) / sum(total, na.rm = TRUE) 1/2*sum(abs(a - b), na.rm = TRUE) } In this function, ind stands for counts of the given indicator, such as the number of students in the school receiving free or reduced price lunch. The total argument refers to the total number of students in the school. The ind argument is assumed to be a vector of counts for schools in the district, while total can be either a vector of the same length or a scalar. Please see the previous blog post for a more detailed explanation of the body of this function (and as always, feel free to get in touch if it’s still confusing).\nOne thing to note is that the first thing the function does is check if at least 50% of schools in the district report free or reduced price lunch (FRL) data. This is because districts in Oregon do not report FRL counts if there are fewer than 7 students in the school that receive FRL services. The 50% cutoff is arbitrary, and we might want to look at other values, but it’s just what I decided on for now. We need FRL eligibility data for at least half the schools in the district to obtain an overall district-level estimate of economic segregation.\nNow, let’s calculate it for each district.\ndissims \u0026lt;- d %\u0026gt;% group_by(leaid) %\u0026gt;% summarize(d = dissim(frl, total)) dissims ## # A tibble: 198 x 2 ## leaid d ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 4100003 0.3188406 ## 2 4100014 0.2997763 ## 3 4100015 0.4084939 ## 4 4100016 0.2035 ## 5 4100019 0.2768065 ## 6 4100020 0.2999805 ## 7 4100021 0.3070539 ## 8 4100023 0.2578609 ## 9 4100040 0.2535497 ## 10 4100043 0.4610778 ## # … with 188 more rows Hooray!

Using the latter method, we find that the top three most economically segregated districts in Oregon, according to the dissimilarity index, are Santiam Canyon School District in Linn County, Mitchell School District in Wheeler County, and ODE YCEP District, which is a district operated by the state and spans multiple counties (so it probably makes sense that this district would be more economically segregated).\n Visualize the results Now we have the numbers, what do they look like when mapped? We just need to join these data with our school district boundaries data and plot the results.\nor \u0026lt;- or %\u0026gt;% mutate(leaid = as.numeric(as.character(GEOID))) %\u0026gt;% left_join(dissims) reference_points \u0026lt;- tibble( city = c(\u0026quot;Portland\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Eugene\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Medford\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bend\u0026quot;), lat = c(45.523452, 44.052069, 42.336896, 44.058173), lon = c(-122.676207, -123.086754, -122.854244, -121.31531) ) library(colorspace) ggplot(or) + geom_sf(aes(fill = d), size = 0.1, color = \u0026quot;gray40\u0026quot;) + geom_point(aes(x = lon, y = lat), data = reference_points) + ggrepel::geom_label_repel(aes(x = lon, y = lat, label = city), data = reference_points, min.segment.length = 0) + scale_fill_continuous_diverging(name = \u0026quot;Group Representation\u0026quot;, palette = \u0026quot;Green-Orange\u0026quot;, mid = mean(or$d, na.rm = TRUE), na.value = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;) Note that I’ve used a diverging palette to highlight districts with relatively higher or lower economic segregation estimates relative to the overall sample average. It also appears essentially all of our missing data is in the Southeastern part of the state, which is not terrifically surprising given that this is the least densely populated area of Oregon. I’ve annotated the map with a few of the larger cities in Oregon. Overall, there’s surprisingly little pattern here. Perhaps changing the method we use to estimate segregation will change that somewhat, but it is sort of nice to see that, for example, areas of dense population do not necessarily have higher economic segregation rates.\nThat’s it for now, please get in touch if you have any questions!\n ","date":1595376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595453923,"objectID":"ca71c66150d1aace32839c318d5efe92","permalink":"/post/school-district-level-segregation/","publishdate":"2020-07-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/school-district-level-segregation/","section":"post","summary":"In the last post we talked a bit about segregation and I showed how to calculate segregation across Oregon using census tracts to estimate segregation levels in counties.

Plenty of projects have documented that American cities, in particular, are segregated to an alarming degree (for example, see this 2018 article by Aaron Williams and Armand Emamdjomeh in the Washinton Post). The segregation itself is not accidental, and is a major indicator of structrual discrimination, with the opportunities of groups of people systematically suppressed relative to others.\nSegregation is often used in research when investigating large-scale social issues. For example, how do rates of obesity differ between people living in highly segregated areas from those living in more diverse areas? When investigating these differenes, however, it is critical that we consider the conditions driving the segregation, and not just the segregation itself. Generally, it is not the segregation itself that drives these differences, but rather differential opportunities between communities. Measures of segregation can be a useful indicator of structural discrimination.\nA considerable number of different methods for measuring segregation exist, each built on different theories and with different strengths and weaknesses. In this post, I’ll discuss three such measures of segregation, \\(d\\), \\(r\\), and \\(h\\), the differences among them, and how we can calculate them in R.\nMeasures of segregation Massey and Denton (1988) categorized measures of segregation into five broad categories: evenness, exposure, concentration, centralization, and clustering. These are defined as follows:\n Evenness refers to how evenly two group of people are distribtued across a specific area.\n Exposure refers to the “degree of potential contact, or the possibility of interaction, between minority and majority group members within geographic areas” (p. 287).\n Concentration refers to the physical space occupied a given group. For example, a group that makes up 25% of a city’s population but resides in only 12% of its land mass would be said to be relatively concentrated.\n Centralization is related to concentration, but specifically indexes the degree to which a given group is located near the center of urban areas.\n Clustering refers to the extent to which specific groups of people are spatially clustered\n  In this post, we’ll focus on the dissimilarity index, which is a measure of evenness. There are two versions of this statistic, one of which accounts for the spatial distribution of points, and one that does not. After a brief explanation below, we’ll get into an applied example with R.\nDissimilarity index Perhaps the most common measure of segregation is known as the dissimilarity index. The dissimilarity index is defined as\n\\[ d = \\frac{1}{2}\\Sigma_{i = 1}^{N}\\left\\lvert\\frac{a_i}{A} - \\frac{b_i}{B}\\right\\rvert \\] where \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) are the population of \\(A\\) or \\(B\\), repectively, in area \\(i\\). More concretely, imagine we wanted to use the dissimilarity index to estimate the segregation of a county based on census tracts. In that case \\(a_i\\) would represent the population of our “a” group in census tract \\(i\\), while \\(A\\) would represent the overall population for the county (and similarly with \\(b_i\\) and \\(B\\)). Each census tract, \\(i\\), would then have a value representing whether a given group was over- or under-represented for that area. To estimate the overall segregation in the county, we would take the absolute value of all of these differences, sum them, and divide by two (halve the resulting value).\nThe dissimilarity index is widely used and fairly easy to interpret. It represents the proportion of people that would need to be “redistributed” for the representation to be equal. The primary drawback of the dissimilarity index is a non-spatial measure–i.e., it does not “appropriately take into account the spatial patterning of population distributions” (Reardon \u0026amp; O’Sullivan, 2004).\nAlternatively, we can use measures that directly account for the spatial distribution, including a spatial measure of \\(d\\). Unlike the non-spatial index of \\(d\\), this measure does not represent the percentage of people that would have to relocate to obtain pure evenness, but it does provide an alternative representation of how different a local environment is from the overall environment. It’s esimtation is considerably more complex (see Reardon \u0026amp; O’Sullivan for a complete description) but, luckily, is easily estimable in R via the seg package in R.\n  An applied example Let’s look at an applied example. First we’ll get some data. If you’d like to follow along, you’ll need to first get an API key for the US Census (see the documentation from tidycensus here). And, of course, you’ll need to have R installed on your local computer, along with each of the packages (all of which can be installed with install.packages(\"pkg_name\")).\nI’ll start by getting census tract data for Oregon on the number of people who identified as Hispanic or White. I’ll then extract the county and subset it to just lane county.\nlibrary(tidyverse) theme_set(theme_minimal(15) + theme(legend.position = \u0026quot;bottom\u0026quot;, legend.key.width = unit(1, \u0026quot;cm\u0026quot;))) library(colorspace) library(tidycensus) options(tigris_class = \u0026quot;sf\u0026quot;) or_tracts \u0026lt;- get_acs(\u0026quot;tract\u0026quot;, variables = c(hisp = \u0026quot;B03002_012\u0026quot;, white = \u0026quot;B03002_003\u0026quot;), state = \u0026quot;OR\u0026quot;, output = \u0026quot;wide\u0026quot;, geometry = TRUE) %\u0026gt;% mutate(county = gsub(\u0026quot;.+\\\\d,\\\\s(.+)\\\\sCounty.+\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\\\\1\u0026quot;, NAME)) lane \u0026lt;- or_tracts %\u0026gt;% filter(county == \u0026quot;Lane\u0026quot;) This gives us a dataset that looks like this\nlane ## Simple feature collection with 87 features and 7 fields (with 1 geometry empty) ## geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: -124.1587 ymin: 43.43739 xmax: -121.7681 ymax: 44.29054 ## geographic CRS: NAD83 ## First 10 features: ## GEOID NAME hispE hispM whiteE ## 1 41039001002 Census Tract 10.02, Lane County, Oregon 295 144 3263 ## 2 41039001804 Census Tract 18.04, Lane County, Oregon 137 94 3324 ## 3 41039001902 Census Tract 19.02, Lane County, Oregon 1055 339 5242 ## 4 41039002201 Census Tract 22.01, Lane County, Oregon 195 143 3254 ## 5 41039000404 Census Tract 4.04, Lane County, Oregon 586 292 3217 ## 6 41039000702 Census Tract 7.02, Lane County, Oregon 120 78 2245 ## 7 41039000902 Census Tract 9.02, Lane County, Oregon 105 73 4523 ## 8 41039001201 Census Tract 12.01, Lane County, Oregon 207 190 3096 ## 9 41039003102 Census Tract 31.02, Lane County, Oregon 506 147 5108 ## 10 41039003700 Census Tract 37, Lane County, Oregon 582 105 3385 ## whiteM geometry county ## 1 323 MULTIPOLYGON (((-123.3196 4...

In fact, it’s as easy as\nggplot(lane) + geom_sf() But what we really want to do is understand the distribution, or evenness, of people who identified as Hispanic versus White.

Similary, green values indicat areas where people who identify as Hispanic are under-represented.\nWe can calculate the overall segregation for lane county by summing the absolute values for all differences, and multiplying this value by 1/2.\n1/2*sum(abs(lane$diff)) ## [1] 0.2758299 As we see, Lane county is not tremendously segregated, but approximately 29% of people would have to move to achieve full evennness.\nWe can verify that our answer is correct using the seg package\nlibrary(seg) ## Loading required package: sp library(sf) ## Linking to GEOS 3.8.0, GDAL 3.0.4, PROJ 6.3.1 lane %\u0026gt;% st_drop_geometry() %\u0026gt;% # drop the geometry column select(hispE, whiteE) %\u0026gt;% # select only the columns we need dissim(data = .) %\u0026gt;% # estimate %\u0026gt;% pluck(\u0026quot;d\u0026quot;) # pull just the non-spatial d ## [1] 0.2758299 Success!\nBut what if we wanted to calculate the spatial version?

Here, we’re looking at essentially the same thing but using county populations as the comparator, so we can get a sense of the between-county variance in segregation.\nThat’s it for now!

They include (among others): percentage of children living in food insecure households, abuse and neglect rates, threat of harm rates, children in foster care and the juvenile justice system, infant

The investigative team (learn more in the people section) is leveraging various large-scale datasets collected on preschool children and their families to develop models that can guide intervention efforts and enhance children’s readiness to learn. The goal? Development of an innovative risk model that pools child, school, and community variables to clarify and strengthen intervention priorities.\nWhat We\u0026rsquo;re Doing Now This project is early in the seed grant period. Our three objectives during this phase are to\n  Develop a new data archive that pools economic and health-related outcomes with data on children’s readiness for kindergarten.\n  Develop an initial “risk profile” model, forecasting the kindergarten readiness of children within specific communities, including evaluating the relative importance of different variables in the prediction algorithm.\n  Assemble an initial data system and preliminary models that will be expanded in an R01 application to NICHD.\n  We\u0026rsquo;re focused primarily on the child and community level data at this point.\nSchool \u0026amp; Child Level Data School data and student data are provided by the Oregon Department of Education (ODE) with whom the project team has a long-standing relationship of collaboration, as well as existing data sharing agreements. We use data on the school facilities, staff demographics and student body demographic makeup in addition to data from the Oregon Kindergarten Assessment (OKA).\nThe OKA measures children’s school readiness through the assessment of pre-academic (emergent literacy and mathematics) and classroom behavior regulation competencies crucial for successful transitions to kindergarten.2 OKA data were obtained for every student in the state from the 2013/14 school year, when the assessment was first administered to all incoming kindergarten students, through the current 2019-2020 school year.\nWe have collected basic student demographic data including\n economic disadvantage status - defined by eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch. gender race / ethnicity home addresses at the time the test was administered - this allows us to directly link individual student data to community variables via spatial joins  Community Level Data At the community level, we focus primarily on economic and health-related data associated with the broad risk factors of early childhood:\n poverty unsafe housing domestic conflict abuse inadequate nutrition  These data have been collected from the Annie E Casey Foundation (Kidscount) and the ACS 2017, a 5-year survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau.\nThe Kidscount data, complied at the county level for each of Oregon\u0026rsquo;s 362 counties, include\n percentage of children living in food insecure households rates of child abuse and neglect threat of harm rates number of children in foster care number of children in the juvenile justice system rates of infant mortality teen pregnancy rates rates of adequate prenatal care  Variables from the ACS 2017 were collected at the census tract level. There are 8343 census tracts in Oregon. They include information on\n rates of children living in households with poverty status median family income rates of children living in households that receive public assistance such as supplemental nutrition benefits distribution of home values distribution of educational attainment  More Data Moving forward, we\u0026rsquo;re inquiring after data regarding other community health and economic indicators from DHS, Facebook, and additional researchers.\nData Directory This documentation page provides names, descriptions, and sources for variables we have collected for our preliminary modeling.\n  Anderson, D., 2019; Fryer \u0026amp; Levitt, 2004, 2006; García, 2015 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n McClelland, Acock, \u0026amp; Morrison, 2006 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n US Census Bureau \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1590105600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590172948,"objectID":"1e56255701c2a00afd6dc594b164f4d8","permalink":"/post/data_post_1/","publishdate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/data_post_1/","section":"post","summary":"An Introduction OR-K-Entry, the research project shared on this site, is designed to address the racial/ethnic and socio-economic disparities in school readiness for incoming kindergarten students, of which there are many1.","tags":["data","milestone"],"title":"Data Sources \u0026 Variables for OR-K-Entry","type":"post"}]
